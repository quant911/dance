A BRIEF DOCUMENTATION

Major Classes:

IKActuatorForce
This is the main class.  It handles all the input and output, and manages all the data structures

IKassembler
The assembler helps to manage some of the data sturctures, and has the solve routine which solves the IK 
problem.

IK_Constraint
Holds data on the a particular goal, and has routines for optimizing joint angles to acheive that goal.   
Currently there are two subclasses of IKconstraint, posConstraint and orientConstraint.  

IK_Joint
Contains a translation matrix, and routines for using and modifying the matrix. Each IK_Joint has only 
one degree of freedom, and corresponds to a DOF in a Joint in the ArticualtedObject.




Major Data Structures:

recs
recs is a member of IKActuatorForce. It is a list of DOFrecords.
It is stored in numerical order, so the DOFrecord::add procedure and DOFrecord::find procedure should be 
called on the first DOFrecord in the list to modify it.  (Don't use the list::add procedure)

Each DOFrecord with a positive number corresponds to a joint in the Articulated Object, and it holds a 
pointer to an IK_Joint for every DOF of the Joint.  There is a DOFrecord corresponding to the root IK_Joint,
which has no real Joint, and number -1


joints
joints is a member of the IKassembler class, and is list of IKdata.
The list is stored in random order.

Each IKdata holds a pointer to an IK_Joint, and which constraints the IK_Joint should be optimized for.


allConstraints
is a member of the IKassembler class. It is simply a list of all the IKconstraints.

root
The root member of the IKassembler class is an the root IK_Joint.  from the root, all the IKJoints can be accessed by traveling down through child joints.
