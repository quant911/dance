Installation
-------------

This is a short installation manual. For more info read the Installation
section in doc/usemanual.{ps,pdf,html}

The DANCE system is packaged as a single archived file which expands
into a directory structure, complete with standard subdirectory names.
Once you have expanded the archive into a given path location, you
must then set a special DANCE_DIR environment variable to point to
that location.  The first two sections describe how to install a
{\em development} environment for DANCE on Windows-based and
Unix-based operating systems respectively. The third section
describes how to install a run-only version of
DANCE.  

Expanding on Windows 95/98/NT/2000
----------------------------------

Use the danceWinXX.zip file archive, where XX refers to a specific
version number. Using a Windows-based file unarchiver like WinZip, you
can expand the file into a desired target destination <pathname>. 
After expanding, the DANCE distribution should be located in: 
<pathname>/dance.

To set the environment variable, there are two possibilities:

[\bf Windows NT] From the Start -> Settings -> Control Panel window,
click on the System applet. Choose the environment tab and create a
new DANCE_DIR environment variable with the value set to
<pathname>/dance.  NOTE: It is VERY important to use forward slashes
in the entire path of DANCE_DIR because dance uses Tcl/Tk as its
scripting environment. Several operations in Tcl assume that the
forward slash convention is used to separate out directory names in
Tcl and may fail if the Windows backslash convention is used
instead. This also ensures consistency of pathnames across multiple
operating systems.  You can set DANCE_DIR either as a system variable
or user variable depending on whether you want to share a common dance
distribution with all users on the same computer or have each user
have their own DANCE distribution directory.

[\bf Windows 98] From a dos command-line or compatible shell
window, you can set the DANCE_DIR as follows:
set DANCE\_DIR=<pathname>/dance
This line can also be placed in the autoexec.bat file for automatic
initialization during boot-up, as would be desired for Windows 98.

Finally, the PATH environment variable should be set to include the DANCE
distribution directory:
set PATH=%PATH%;<pathname>\dance\bin.

As an example, if I unarchived DANCE into D:\Work\dance, I would set DANCE_DIR to
D:/Work/dance and the PATH would include D:\Work\dance\bin.

Expanding on Unix-based operating systems
-----------------------------------------

The procedure for Unix-based operating systems (so far tested on Linux and
Irix), is similar to Windows. Simply unarchive the appropriate OS distribution in the
destination directory:

tar -zxvf danceUnixXX.tgz

where XX refers to the version number.
The DANCE_DIR environment variable should be set using the method of
whichever shell you are using. 

For example, one could use
setenv DANCE_DIR <pathname>/dance 
or
set DANCE_DIR=<pathname>/dance 

In addition, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include <pathname>/dance/lib/Linux or
<pathname>/dance/lib/Irix. For example 
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:<pathname>/dance/lib/Linux

Lastly, set your path variable to include <pathname>/dance/bin.

Run-only Version
-----------------

The Run-only version is a restricted distribution that contains only
the files necessary to operate the DANCE application and its installed
plug-ins. It is not possible to develop with DANCE, as the source
directories for the core program and the plug-ins, the include files,
and the link libraries are all not included. This distribution is
useful if you want to distribute DANCE only for demonstration
purposes. In the $DANCE_DIR/scripts directory, you will find a
shell-script called "CreateRunTime". This script contains the unix
shell commands needed to create a run-time version of DANCE. The
script should be run from the desired destination directory where you
would like to install the dance root directory and the required
subdirectories. This script will work in a Windows environment if the
Cygnus tools are installed. Alternatively, you can replace the unix
commands with their DOS equivalents (for example, replace cp with
copy) to create a batch file which does the equivalent operations.
